A free <b>QlikView App</b> that allows you to <b>visualize</b> your QlikView solution as <b>a system of related elements</b>.

The application scans your QV environment and automatically discovers dependencies between QVW Apps, QVD Tables, Flat files etc.
Then it shows you what the properties of the system are: it's goals (i.e. final user analytical apps), inputs and outputs of the elements, the complexity of direct and indirect relations. All in form of a single image - graph. And in lists of course.
 
<h2>Search and navigate the dependencies in an associative manner</h2>
 
Just filter any Entity of interest and instantly find out which other Entities depend on this one, even if they lay far behind in a data flow. So you know where a collision would rise if you made any harmful changes (say removing a field) to this particular Element.
<h2>Analyze the lineage of your data</h2>
When facing a question like "what exact data sources are you using for this specific QVW App?", you'll be ready to answer it in seconds. Just make a search in Entities listbox and filter out the one, then filter Ancestor relations. 
Now you have all the necessary information - a list of all sources and transformations involved in data flows as well as their abstract scheme on the graph.
<h2>Get a visibility into data structures</h2>
Simply said, data in a QlikView solution is organised into Data Models (QVW) plus Data Files (QVD/Flat files) and Tables plus Fields inside them.
The application helps you find out similarities and differences and relations between those mentioned. For example: which fields are most commonly used and which - least? Which App has the widest Fact table? If you are to make changes to a field - what Apps need to be considered? And so on.
